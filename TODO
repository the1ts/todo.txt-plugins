Allow stop start in past using format 2012-06-13 13:15 format, useful for those that forgot to turn off a counting up clock and wish to fix. Perhaps use question answer to get time required. Easier in bash than 3 hours 15 minutes ago and convert.

documents

Move all but README.md to docs directory or move each specific readme to its directory, needs fixing in makefile here and deb build for either option.
