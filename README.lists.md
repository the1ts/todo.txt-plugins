# README - Lists

There are a few listings that would be useful to have, there are some here.

## List actions

Listactions lists both builtin functions and current actions

Usage: ```todo.sh listactions```

## List projects without a priority set

Listprjnopri lists any project that doesn't have a priority set. So it shows us which projects haven't been given priority attention lately.

Usage: ```todo.sh listprjnopri```
