# README for bash completion

This bash completion covers all the builtin actions for todo.txt along with my own in this repository. It has the concept of snippets that are put in /usr/share/todo.txt/bash_completion.d/actions/. This allows completion of both builtin actions along with context, project or notes actions in this repository.
