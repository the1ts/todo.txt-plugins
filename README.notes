README file for notes actions

These actions are to create a notes ability to todo.txt shell script. It enables you to add notes files associated with one or many tasks in your todo file or files.

The old syntax was %notesfile. This has been changed as per the Add-on File Format Definitions from The todo.txt format page. The new syntax is note:notesfile.

There are a couple of manual tasks required to use these scripts.

1. Create a notes directory in your .todo directory. See $TODO_DIR in your todo.cfg file.
2. Create an archive directory within the above directory. (Just like tasks notes are archived not deleted).

Editing notes
To create a notes file create a task with your chosen note file name, i.e. append note:note_name to a task. Then run notesedit to create that note, i.e. todo.sh notesedit note_name. This also works for existing notes.

Listing notes
To list notes run lsnotes, you will get a list of all notes in your todo.txt file.

Grep notes
To find those notes that contain a word or phrase, they are listed in the note: format

Showing notes
To show notes, there is a notescat action, to use run todo.sh notescat notes_name

To add a note
Add a note to an item line via notesadd action

Archiving notes
When you have completed all tasks associated with a notes file you can archive the note file. First we check the note_name isn't used any current todo item then add to notes/archive/note_name.txt. If this file already exists we add the date then the contests of the note to archive. This way you can track notes over time.

NB. make sure the note name is a single word (no spaces), this is the same restriction as projects and contexts. Notes actions also know about files created with the tickle action.
